        "3 - Due to constraints in the graphical representation and data wrangling, we chose to only consider 2 actors from certain movies in the top 250. We did not use the fullCast API call, and instead relied purely on the 2 actors supplied in the Top250 API call. This severely cut down on the amount of connections each actor has on our graph - The code works the same, but the data passed through itlimited it heavily. We felt that clarity in the graphical nature of the graph was worth sacrificing the averaging number of connections per actor. For the few actors shown, some will have 0, some will have 2, 3, 4, etc. To reduce this bias, we could have passed in more data, however a graphical representation in this environment would be very ugly.****\n",

Despite many of these actors being world-class actors, they undoubtedly have worked on flop movies - movies that wouldn't show up in the top 250 IMDB database. This would have increased the number of connections, as the top 250 limits the data passed once again."
